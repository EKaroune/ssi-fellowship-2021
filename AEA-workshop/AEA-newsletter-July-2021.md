## Open Science Skills Workshop - Autumn 2021

We had very positive responses about the proposal of an open science skills workshop as our autumn event. Therefore, this will be planned to occur this coming November and will be an introductory workshop to all things open science and highlight lots of available resources. 

We were very happy to hear your opinions about accessibility to this workshop so we are trying to take as many of these into account as possible. 
* The workshop will be fully online and free.
* It will be a full day session - the session will run twice on two different dates - one on a weekday and one on the weekend. 
* The weekend session will be timed to be accessible to our members in North and South America. 
* It will be kept to a small group, probably a maximum of 30 attendees for each session, so that it can be a combination of talks and small group discussion sessions. 
* We will also record the talks and make all the materials openly accessible so that members who are not able to attend can take advantage of these resources.

The specific dates and booking arrangements will be advertised in the next newsletter. 

If you have any questions about this workshop or are interested in helping, please do get in touch with Emma Karoune (ekaroune@googlemail.com).

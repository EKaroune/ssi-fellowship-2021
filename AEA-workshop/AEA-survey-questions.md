### The AEA membership survey

We want to find out your opinions about our association. There are questions about where you work, where you are based, your opinions of current membership activities and benefits. The survey is completely anonymous and takes about ten minutes. 

Please take some time to fill it in and we would like to thank you in advance for your input.

### Autumn event

With the continuing uncertainty over the pandemic, the AEA committee has decided to move our Autumn Conference to Spring 2022. This will hopefully allow us to meet in person, although we foresee that many people will still not want to travel, and therefore a hybrid event is likely to be the best way forward. 

Consequently, this autumn there will not be a conference or series of webinars. However, after the success and wonderful discussions at the recent Spring Conference, we are proposing to run an Open Science Skills Workshop. This will enable our community to explore many different aspects of open science and learn about tools and resources.

To help us plan the open science workshop, we have added several questions to the end of the AEA membership survey. This is to find out what you want so we can make it as useful as possible. 

We want to know:
* What aspects of open science are you interested in learning about?
* How much time can you spend training? 
* How can we make the event as accessible and inclusive as possible?

Once the survey responses have come back, we will then give out more information about how and when the open science workshop will proceed.

If you are interested in helping with this event, please contact Emma Karoune - ekaroune@googlemail.com

A google form was set up for the AEA membership survey.
